This is the log, where I will document and sum up my work during the challange every day

Day 3/100
Today I worked with my JavaScript book (Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke) doing 3 simple tasks and with my portfolio website
project from FreeCodeCamp. During the evening I'm also going to proceed with my Unity course. I find using Git command line way simplier 
than using some visual UI (eg. Sourctree). I guess this is what I needed to get used to git. As normally I prefer visual UIs, this
command line is better, at least for me.

Day 2/100
Today I had a really crazy day (and the coming weekend will be so crazy also), so I wasn't able to do much. 
However I started working on FreeCodeCamp task - portfolio web-page (with css and html only). I also learned a little bit about
Git Bash and it's commands.

Day 1/100

Today I mainly worked with my Unity course, I'm about to finish soon, but I don't share the files of those Unity projects.
But I also played a little bit with a Code Fights, I finished 2 tasks and leared a few things about basics of C# (like console apps). 
I worked with C# a lot, but I never had a chance to get to the basics of this language syntax. The thing I want to also do is reading
about C# System class in the documentation. Maybe during the next few days.
The files of Codefights are in this Github folder: https://github.com/tabupl/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/CodeFights
