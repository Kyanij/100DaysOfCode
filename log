Day 1/100

Today I mainly worked with my Unity course, I'm about to finish soon, but I don't share the files of those Unity projects.
But I also played a little bit with a Code Fights, I finished 2 tasks and leared a few things about basics of C# (like console apps). 
I worked with C# a lot, but I never had a chance to get to the basics of this language syntax. The thing I want to also do is reading
about C# System class in the documentation. Maybe during the next few days.
The files of Codefights are in this Github folder: https://github.com/tabupl/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/CodeFights
